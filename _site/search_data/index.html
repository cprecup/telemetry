      "title": "Filtering Telemetry for RSVP-TE Auto-Bandwidth Demo",
      "content": "Telemetry recently took center stage at SDX Demo Friday with a new demo showcasing the RSVP-TE auto-bandwidth feature.  In the demo, the TE tunnel headend streamed data about the output bytes sent per tunnel and the resulting applied auto-bandwidth.  We streamed the data to SignalFX’s cloud monitoring system and were able to show nice visualizations of auto-bandwidth in action as well as some cool alerting capabilities.This demo gave us an opportunity to exercise the new filtering capability in IOS XR 6.0.1. The operational data for a TE Tunnel headend is contained in the native path RootOper.MPLS_TE.P2P_P2MPTunnel.TunnelHead({‘TunnelName’# ‘tunnel-te10’}). Streaming this path would result in over 600 lines of output for a single tunnel, with multiple layers of hierarchy.  To filter that data down to a single value, you can use a IncludeField in the policy file as follows#{   ~Name~#~RSVPTEPolicy~,   ~Metadata~#{      ~Version~#1,      ~Description~#~This policy collects auto bw stats~,      ~Comment~#~This is the first draft~   },   ~CollectionGroups~#{      ~FirstGroup~#{         ~Period~#10,         ~Paths~#{            ~RootOper.MPLS_TE.P2P_P2MPTunnel.TunnelHead({'TunnelName'# 'tunnel-te10'})~#{               ~IncludeFields~#[                  {                     ~P2PInfo~#[                        {                           ~AutoBandwidthOper~#[                              ~LastBandwidthApplied~                           ]                        }                     ]                  }               ]            }         }      }   }}With this IncludeFilter, the telemetry engine will only encode the latest applied auto-bandwidth value for the specified TE tunnel (which is nested two levels down from the top level of the path).Filtering on the router is a big win from a performance perspective.  Obviously, the collector (SignalFX in this case) benefits if it has to process less data.  But the router benefits, too.  Internally, the telemetry process still retrieves the entire “bag” of data (i.e. the 600 lines of stuff) to take advantage of bulk retrieval optimizations.  That’s pretty much a fixed cost in terms of CPU utilization.  The good news is that filtering optimizations allow the encoding process to completely skip over everything except the fields you want.  Skipping is much more efficient than processing, which decreases the demand on the CPU.  Moreover, the resulting data stream is much smaller.  Since a large proportion of the telemetry CPU usage is for packet IO, a smaller data stream again means less CPU utilization.  So for maximum efficiency, filter when you can!",

      "title": "Model-Driven Telemetry: Dial-In or Dial-Out ?",
      "content": "     Dial-In or Dial-Out?  Transport Options  Dial-Out Vs. Dial-In  TCP Dial-Out  gRPC Dial-Out  gRPC Dial-In  Decisions, Decisions  Transport OptionsIn one of my first tutorials on configuring Model-Driven Telemetry (MDT), I blithely referred to three options for transport# TCP dial-out, gRPC dial-out and gRPC dial-in.  It’s all well and good to know how to configure each one, but what’s the difference and which one should you choose?  This blog tackles those questions.Dial-Out Vs. Dial-InWhen we say “dial-out,” we are speaking from the router’s perspective# the router “dials out” to the collector.  In other words, the router sends the SYN packet in the TCP handshake.Anyone who has had to modify ACLs to enable a new SNMP manager to connect to the network can appreciate the value of the dial-out option.  Since the router initiates the connection, you don’t have to worry about opening up ports for inbound management traffic.  Dial-out can also leverage Anycast addresses for HA and/or load-balancing.With dial-in, on the other hand, the router listens passively on a specified port until the collector “dials-in.”After the initial session establishment, the router still pushes the data off the box at the configured interval.  This is very important!  Don’t be fooled by the direction of the SYN packet.  There is no polling mechanism in MDT.Dial-in appeals to folks who are looking for a “single channel” to communicate with the network.  These are operators who want a single transport and protocol for both configuration data and streaming operational data. Sound impossible?  Well, we’re already doing it today.TCP Dial-OutOur first dial-out protocol was also the simplest# plain old TCP.  Open up a raw TCP socket on your collector and the router will complete the standard three-way handshake and start pushing telemetry data across the session.  No fancy programming libraries are required on the collector – in python it’s a simple matter of a “bind” to the port.  TCP dial-out inherits all the goodness of TCP (reliable delivery, fragmentation, re-ordering, etc) without having to invent a new protocol or define new mechanisms.  It’s a great place to start if you’re configuring MDT for the first time.gRPC Dial-OutOne of TCP’s great strengths is its simplicity.  But TCP by itself lacks higher-level functions that can enable more secure and sophisticated communication between the router and the collector.  For that, we turned to gRPC.gRPC is an open source communication framework built on top of HTTP/2.  It was originally designed by Google to enable efficient, accurate and low-latency communication between clients and servers.  It has many functions beyond those required by MDT.One of the main reasons that people enable gRPC dial-out is that gRPC allows you to do authentication and encryption via TLS.  If you’re worried about sending operational data in the clear and/or you want to protect your collector with certificate-based authentication, enable gRPC with TLS.Another bonus is that gRPC handles pesky details around async communications and the associated file descriptor handling. So you might actually find it easier to use than TCP as you scale to multiple routers.gRPC is not quite as trivial from a protocol perspective, but one of its strengths is the plethora of idiomatic client libraries in multiple programming languages.  Go, Python, Ruby, Java, C developers – grab your gRPC library from github and you’ll be juggling gRPC sessions like a pro.gRPC Dial-InIn addition to secure and efficient transport, gRPC provides bidirectional streaming and connection multiplexing.  This means that you can “dial-in” to a router, push down new configs (including telemetry subscription configs) and have operational data streamed back – all within a single, unified channel, all using the same underlying data models.  Cisco IOS XR has supported configuration via gRPC since 6.0.0 and dial-in telemetry over gRPC since 6.1.1.Since the collector “dials-in” to the router, there’s no need to specify each MDT destination in the configuration.  Just enable the gRPC service on the router, connect your client, and dynamically enable the telemetry subscription you want.Of course, like all the other methods, there are trade-offs. A dial-in subscription is transient.  If you lose it, the client (the collector) is responsible for re-establishing it.  You will also have to think more carefully about how you want to do load-balancing.Decisions, DecisionsSo what transport should you use for MDT?  Here’s a few quick heuristics#  If you’re looking for a quick and simple solution for a single router and collector, try TCP dial-out.  It’s simple to configure, there are no new protocols to learn, and you won’t have to worry about opening up inbound connections.  If you need encryption or you need help scaling out to many devices, take a look at gRPC dial-out.  If you’re already using gRPC for configuration, consider gRPC dial-in.As you deploy MDT, you may find that your transport needs change or evolve.  No problem.  The most important thing to remember is that the push mechanism for telemetry data remains exactly the same, dial-in or dial-out, TCP or gRPC.  No matter what you choose, you’ll get the same data, in the same data model, at the same speed.  That’s the beauty of Model-Driven Telemetry.",

      "title": "Enhancing a CiscoLive Demo with Telemetry and Kafka",
      "content": "     Enhancing Demos with Telemetry  Behind the Scenes of Continuous Automation  The Easy Part# Data Model and Router Config  The Other Easy Part# Pipeline and Kafka  The Easiest Part  A Quick Python Script  In Sum  Behind the Scenes of Continuous AutomationEvery year at Cisco Live, my team helps put together the demos that go into the World of Solutions. Geeks that we are, we get a thrill out of showing off the art of the possible. But the real purpose of a demo is to start a conversation with the folks who stop by our booth.This year, a colleague asked me to help integrate model-driven telemetry (MDT) into a Service Provider demo called “Continuous Automation.” The goal of the demo is to illustrate how MDT can be used with model-driven APIs to automate a simple provisioning and validation task (it’s loosely based on a real customer use case that he’s actively working on).Pieces of the demo were already in place# a small Python app that utilized the YDK Python APIs to configure a BGP neighbor and execute a connectivity test from the router when the neighbor came up.  The problem was that the app had no way to know when the neighbor came up.  Enter MDT!The Easy Part# Data Model and Router ConfigThe operational data that we needed was the BGP neighbor session state.  This is easily available in the OpenConfig BGP model#module# openconfig-bgp   +--rw bgp      +--rw neighbors         +--rw neighbor* [neighbor-address]            +--ro state               +--ro session-state?   enumerationTranslating this into an MDT sensor path config for the router looks like this#telemetry model-driven sensor-group BGP  sensor-path openconfig-bgp#bgp/neighbors/neighbor/stateNote# For a detailed explanation of MDT router configurations, see my basic MDT tutorial).Adding a destination-group and a subscription starts the router streaming out the needed data#telemetry model-driven destination-group G1  address-family ipv4 198.18.1.127 port 5432   encoding self-describing-gpb   protocol tcp  ! subscription S1  sensor-group-id BGP sample-interval 5000  destination-id G1But then what?  How do you get data from a TCP stream into a Python app?The Other Easy Part# Pipeline and KafkaMy go-to tool for consuming MDT data is pipeline, an open source utility that I’ve written about before.  If you’re not familiar with installing and configuring pipeline, have a read through my previous tutorial.For this demo, I used the  [testbed] input stage in the default pipeline.conf.  With the following lines uncommented, the default pipeline.conf will work “as-is” with the router MDT configuration in the previous section.[testbed]stage = xport_inputtype = tcpencap = stlisten = #5432That’s good for input, but what about output?  Pipeline can write data to three destinations#  a file  time series databases like InfluxDB  KafkaWriting to a file would probably work (Python has extensive file handling capabilities) but it seemed clumsy.  Writing to InfluxDB would also have worked (I could use Python REST packages to query the database) but seemed too heavy weight for a simple demo.  That left me with Kafka.  I’ve been wanting to do a Kafka demo for a while and there are Python packages to work with Kafka, so I figured…why not?  If nothing else, I’ll learn something new.For pipeline to output to Kafka, all you have to do is uncomment the following lines in the [mykafka] section of the default pipeline.conf. In the example below, I’m running pipeline and Kafka on the same machine, so I used the broker address of “localhost” and the topic called “telemetry.”[mykafka]stage = xport_outputtype = kafkaencoding = jsonbrokers = localhost#9092topic = telemetryWith those two entries in the pipeline.conf file, I kicked off pipeline as usual#$ bin/pipeline &amp;[1] 21975Startup pipelineLoad config from [pipeline.conf], logging in [pipeline.log]Wait for ^C to shutdown$The Easiest PartSince I haven’t installed Kafka before, I was concerned that it might be the long pole in my demo prep.  But it couldn’t have been easier.  I followed the first two steps in the Apache Kafka Quickstart guide.  Boom.  Done.  Didn’t even have to alter the default properties files for Kafka and Zookeeper.A Quick Python ScriptWith Kafka, Zookeeper and Pipeline running and the router streaming MDT, all I lacked was a little Python code to subscribe to the topic on Kafka and parse some JSON (by default, pipeline transforms the GPB from the router into a JSON object when it publishes to Kafka). With the kafka-python client, there wasn’t much to it.  Here are a few lines of code I used for a quick test (note that the topic is telemetry and the Pipeline/Kafka stack is running on 10.30.111.4)#from kafka import KafkaConsumerimport jsonif __name__ == ~__main__~#    session_state = ~UNKNOWN~    consumer = KafkaConsumer('telemetry', bootstrap_servers=[~10.30.111.4#9092~])    for msg in consumer#        telemetry_msg =  msg.value        telemetry_msg_json = json.loads(telemetry_msg)        if ~Rows~ in telemetry_msg_json#            content_rows = telemetry_msg_json[~Rows~]            for row in content_rows#            if row[~Keys~][~neighbor-address~] == '10.8.0.1'#                    new_session_state = row[~Content~][~session-state~]                    if session_state != new_session_state#                        print(~\\nSession state changed from {0#s} to {1#s} at epoch time {2#d}~                              .format(session_state, new_session_state, row[~Timestamp~]))                        session_state = new_session_stateIn SumThere was a little more code to write to tie everything together and tidy it up, but my part of the demo was basically done.  From a telemetry perspective, it was trivial to integrate into the demo by using Kafka.  To recap, the main pieces were#  Configure the router to stream BGP session state.  Configure (basically uncomment some lines in the default pipeline.conf) and run pipeline.  Download and run Kafka and Zookeeper.  Use the kafka-python package in a Python script to acquire and process the session state from the telemetry topic on Kafka.Although I didn’t get the learning experience that comes from having really complicated things go deeply wrong, this was a fun little exercise.If you’re in Las Vegas for CiscoLive next week, stop by our booth and talk to us about what you want to do in a model-driven network!",

      "title": "Multithreading in MDT",
      "content": "     On This Page  Collections  A big “bag” of data  A big and a small “bag”  Share the workload  Conclusion  CollectionsHave you ever thought what “sample-interval” really means? And why is it so important to really understand its operation and properly design your telemetry configuration?In this paper, I will explain how collections work internally. The overall process can be divided into three major parts#  Messaging to a router  Internal operations within MDT process  Collecting data from a requested sensor path (and sending back to a collector)It is not very important for our topic whether you have dial-in or dial-out mode configured on your router, so let’s consider a case with dial-in.At the beginning of the session, our router will get a gRPC request message. The configured sample-interval timer starts and an internal MDT process (aka EMSd or Extensible Manageability Services) starts its operations. EMSd requests the information from an internal data source. The built-in efficiency of the IOS XR architecture means that collection time usually takes tens of milliseconds. After the collection is done, information is sent back to EMSd for fast encoding and transport.For a better understanding, take a look into this schema#As soon as a new sample interval starts, MDT sends a new request to the operational data storage and the system follows steps described above.You can check collection time with the following show command (or in the Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-oper.yang YANG model)#RP/0/RP0/CPU0#ios#sh telemetry model-driven subscription 1Sat Jul 22 21#04#22.527 UTCSubscription#  1-------------&lt;&lt;&lt; skipped &gt;&gt;&gt;  Collection Groups#  ------------------    Id# 1    Sample Interval#      5000 ms    Encoding#             self-describing-gpb    Num of collection#    6    Collection time#      Min#    16 ms Max#    17 ms    Total time#           Min#    16 ms Avg#    17 ms Max#    18 ms    Total Deferred#       0    Total Send Errors#    0    Total Send Drops#     0    Total Other Errors#   0    Last Collection Start#2017-07-22 21#04#18.1396342587 +0000    Last Collection End#  2017-07-22 21#04#18.1396360587 +0000    Sensor Path#          Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-countersIn the output above, I’ve highlighted the Total time (collection + MDT encoding) and a sample interval values.  This tells you how much time is needed to collect and encode all the data in a given sensor-path. Information is provided for each sensor-path you have configured.A big “bag” of dataSo far so good# we have a well-defined collection time; we have an optimized sample-interval. But what can go wrong?Imagine you have a system with a high number of routes, or with a big number of MPLS-TE tunnels, or a system with a big number of interfaces/sub-interfaces. Even with optimized collection processes, the amount of data is so big that it takes some time is needed to deliver it back to EMSd. Let’s have a look into the picture again#The steps for the system are the same – we need an initial message request, we need to process information within EMSd, we need to send a request message for the internal data. But because of the amount of data, the collection time will take more than the configured sample-interval.  In this case, IOS XR will continue to collect the original sample and send it as soon as it is complete (which may be after the next sample-interval has expired).  Depending on the sample interval and collection time ratio, it could be even a window after the next sample and so on.EMSd guarantees non-stop operation. So it will request a new sample of data from the storage as soon as it gets current collection back (as a new sample interval has already started).Below is an example of such behavior from a system with a big number of interfaces (just for demo purposes)#RP/0/RP1/CPU0#ios#sh telemetry model-driven subscription 1Sat Jul 22 14#30#29.775 UTCSubscription#  1-------------&lt;&lt;&lt; skipped &gt;&gt;&gt;  Collection Groups#  ------------------    Id# 7    Sample Interval#      5000 ms    Encoding#             self-describing-gpb    Num of collection#    6    Collection time#      Min#    13675 ms Max#    14030 ms    Total time#           Min# 13806 ms Avg# 13940 ms Max# 14067 ms    Total Deferred#       0    Total Send Errors#    0    Total Send Drops#     0    Total Other Errors#   0    No data Instances#    6    Last Collection Start#2017-07-22 14#30#15.3522663588 +0000    Last Collection End#  2017-07-22 14#30#29.3536676588 +0000    Sensor Path#          Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/data-rateAs you see from the outputs, the sample-interval is 5 seconds, but due to the big amount of data, total collection time takes around 14 seconds! That led to the worst-case scenario where several consecutive sample intervals were skipped.A big and a small “bag”The situation described above doesn’t look good. But is that the worst you can expect?Let’s have a look at what might happen if you have multiple sensor-paths to collect and one sensor-path has a big “bag” of data and another one has a small “bag”#We have the same story as before – a request is coming, after which our router needs to start processing and pushing out requested operational data. But we have two sensor-paths to be sent out this time. Let’s say that the collection starts with the biggest one. As before, it takes some long time, exceeding configured sample-interval. And all that time, our request for the second, smaller sensor-path has to sit and wait in the queue for the first collection to be finished. As the result, both collections are delayed and sent during one of the next sample-intervals, even if the second sensor-path collection needs just few milliseconds to be collected and sent out.Here is a snapshot from a router with big number of interfaces#RP/0/RP1/CPU0#ios#sh telemetry model-driven subscription 1Sat Jul 22 14#57#23.911 UTCSubscription#  1&lt;&lt;&lt; skipped &gt;&gt;&gt;  Collection Groups#  ------------------    Id# 9    Sample Interval#      5000 ms    Encoding#             self-describing-gpb    Num of collection#    4    Collection time#      Min#    13650 ms Max#    13707 ms    Total time#           Min# 13840 ms Avg# 13894 ms Max# 13933 ms    Total Deferred#       0    Total Send Errors#    0    Total Send Drops#     0    Total Other Errors#   0    No data Instances#    4    Last Collection Start#2017-07-22 14#57#08.841218292 +0000    Last Collection End#  2017-07-22 14#57#22.855108292 +0000    Sensor Path#          Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/data-rate    Id# 10    Sample Interval#      5000 ms    Encoding#             self-describing-gpb    Num of collection#    4    Collection time#      Min#    10 ms Max#    14 ms    Total time#           Min#    10 ms Avg#    12 ms Max#    14 ms    Total Deferred#       0    Total Send Errors#    0    Total Send Drops#     0    Total Other Errors#   0    No data Instances#    0    Last Collection Start#2017-07-22 14#57#22.855108292 +0000    Last Collection End#  2017-07-22 14#57#22.855121292 +0000    Sensor Path#          Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-countersAs you can see, our second path, which only requires around 12ms of collection time, was delayed by 19 seconds because it had to wait for the first path to complete.Share the workloadIOS XR is a real time, modular software architecture based on processes that operate in separate address spaces with memory protection. Each process consists from a number of threads. EMSd is a process that represents core functionality of MDT within IOS XR. And it also contains a big number of different threads, which execute multiple tasks.Starting in the 6.2.x release train, EMSd will deliver improved performance by creating a separate thread within its architecture to process each “subscription” within MDT configuration. In other words, this enhancement will let you interleave small “bag” sensor-paths with large bag sensor-paths. This means you will be able to send “fast” paths according to expected sample-intervals while giving “slow” paths its own processing.Here is a picture of the enhanced functionality#As soon as a sample-interval starts, a separate thread will be allocated for each “subscription” configured (or to each sensor-path in case you have just one path inside each “subscription” configuration). When a given thread has finished the collection for its paths, the data will be sent immediately. Larger, slower sensor paths will continue collecting and an update will be sent out to collector that collection is still in progress.This is how it will look like on the tested router#RP/0/RP1/CPU0#ios#sh telemetry model-driven subscription 1Sat Jul 22 16#08#41.087 UTCSubscription#  1-------------&lt;&lt;&lt; skipped &gt;&gt;&gt;  Collection Groups#  ------------------    Id# 16    Sample Interval#      5000 ms    Encoding#             self-describing-gpb    Num of collection#    1    Collection time#      Min#    13931 ms Max#    13931 ms    Total time#           Min# 14000 ms Avg# 14000 ms Max# 14000 ms    Total Deferred#       0    Total Send Errors#    0    Total Send Drops#     0    Total Other Errors#   0    No data Instances#    1    Last Collection Start#2017-07-22 16#08#23.821224996 +0000    Last Collection End#  2017-07-22 16#08#37.835224996 +0000    Sensor Path#          Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/data-rateRP/0/RP1/CPU0#ios#sh telemetry model-driven subscription 2Sat Jul 22 16#08#42.777 UTCSubscription#  2-------------&lt;&lt;&lt; skipped &gt;&gt;&gt;  Collection Groups#  ------------------    Id# 17    Sample Interval#      5000 ms    Encoding#             self-describing-gpb    Num of collection#    5    Collection time#      Min#    13 ms Max#    16 ms    Total time#           Min#    13 ms Avg#    14 ms Max#    16 ms    Total Deferred#       0    Total Send Errors#    0    Total Send Drops#     0    Total Other Errors#   0    No data Instances#    0    Last Collection Start#2017-07-22 16#08#42.839437996 +0000    Last Collection End#  2017-07-22 16#08#42.839450996 +0000    Sensor Path#          Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-countersAs you can see, the snapshots were taken almost at the same time, but the number of collections done by the second subscription is way ahead compared to the first one.

Each one will be created for a separate subscription.ConclusionModel-driven telemetry represents the future of high-speed export of operational data. Before 6.2.x releases, you can configure different sample-intervals for different sensor-paths, but as soon as you have a path with a large amount of data in a processing queue, everything else will have to wait until after that collection is finished. Starting from 6.2.x, IOS XR added threading support for MDT. With this capability, we recommend that you separate your sensor-paths into different subscriptions to increase productivity of the router and your ability to get rich amount of different operational data at scale.",

Here’s a quick summary#  Transport# The router can deliver telemetry data either across using TCP or gRPC over HTTP/2.  Some people will prefer the simplicity of a raw TCP socket, others will appreciate the optional TLS encyption that gRPC brings.  Session Initiation# There are two options for initiating a telemetry session.  The router can “dial-out” to the collector or the collector can “dial-in” to the router.  Regardless of which side initiates the session, the router always streams the data to the collector at the requested intervals. TCP supports “dial-out” while gRPC supports both “dial-in” and “dial-out.”  Encoding# The router can deliver telemetry data in two different flavors of Google Protocol Buffers# Compact and Self-Describing GPB.  Compact GPB is the most efficient encoding but requires a unique .proto for each YANG model that is streamed.  Self-describing GPB is less efficient but it uses a single .proto file to decode all YANG models because the keys are passed as strings in the .proto.This tutorial covers the detailed configuration steps for three combinations# TCP Dial-Out, gRPC Dial-Out and gRPC Dial-In, all using the self-describing GPB encoding.Using TCP Dial-OutWith the TCP Dial-Out method, the router initiates a TCP session to the collector and sends whatever data is specified by the sensor-group in the subscription.TCP Dial-Out Router ConfigThere are three steps to configuring the router for telemetry with TCP dial-out# create a destination-group, create a sensor-group, create a subscription.Step 1# Create a destination-groupThe destination-group specifies the destination address, port, encoding and transport that the router should use to send out telemetry data.

      "content": "     Configuring MDT with OpenConfig YANG  Model-Driven Configuration for Model-Driven Telemetry  The Models  Get-Config  Edit-Config  Conclusion  Model-Driven Configuration for Model-Driven TelemetryIn an earlier tutorial, I wrote about how to configure MDT using CLI.  But if the router is using YANG models to structure the operational data it streams, shouldn’t we also be able to use models to configure the telemetry feature itself?  The answer is yes!  In this tutorial, we’ll look at the OpenConfig YANG model for telemetry and how to configure it.  I will use ncclient as a simple Python NETCONF client, but you can use whatever client you want.The ModelsLet’s start with a quick look at the NETCONF capabilities list from IOS XR 6.1.1.  This bit of code#from ncclient import managerimport re    xr = manager.connect(host='10.30.111.9', port=830, username='cisco', password='cisco',\tallow_agent=False,\tlook_for_keys=False,\thostkey_verify=False,\tunknown_host_cb=True)for c in xr.server_capabilities#    model = re.search('module=([^&amp;]*telemetry[^&amp;]*)&amp;', c)    if model is not None#        print model.group(1)     …tells us that there are two models for telemetry configuration#Script Output#openconfig-telemetryCisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-cfgThe first model is the OpenConfig telemetry model and the second is the XR native telemetry model.  If you look at them in detail, you will notice that the native model closely follows the OpenConfig model, although the native model will let you do things that are supported by IOS XR but not defined by this version of OpenConfig (like disabling TLS or enabling dial-out).  In this tutorial, I’ll focus on openconfig-telemetry, but you could do everything with Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-cfg as well.The NETCONF &lt;get-schema&gt; operation will give you the contents of the schema but the full YANG output can be really verbose and overwhelming, so I’ll pipe the output to the pyang utility for a compact tree view with the following bit of code#from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUToc = xr.get_schema('openconfig-telemetry')p = Popen(['pyang', '-f', 'tree'], stdout=PIPE, stdin=PIPE, stderr=PIPE) print(p.communicate(input=oc.data)[0])And voila#Script Output#module# openconfig-telemetry   +--rw telemetry-system      +--rw sensor-groups      |  +--rw sensor-group* [sensor-group-id]      |     +--rw sensor-group-id    -&gt; ../config/sensor-group-id      |     +--rw config      |     |  +--rw sensor-group-id?

Only needed for dial-out configuration.  The sensor-group identifies a list of YANG models that the router should stream.  The subscription ties together the destination-group and the sensor-group.Let’s see how this works in practice.Get-ConfigWe can use the openconfig-telemetry model to filter for the telemetry config with the ncclient get_config operation#filter = '''&lt;telemetry-system xmlns=~http#//openconfig.net/yang/telemetry~&gt;'''c = xr.get_config(source='running', filter=('subtree', filter))print(c)And here’s what we get#Script Output#&lt;?xml version=~1.0~?&gt;&lt;rpc-reply message-id=~urn#uuid#939c718e-81ee-43ec-9733-565aa53fedb2~ xmlns#nc=~urn#ietf#params#xml#ns#netconf#base#1.0~ xmlns=~urn#ietf#params#xml#ns#netconf#base#1.0~&gt; &lt;data&gt;  &lt;telemetry-system xmlns=~http#//openconfig.net/yang/telemetry~&gt;   &lt;sensor-groups&gt;    &lt;sensor-group&gt;     &lt;sensor-group-id&gt;SGroup3&lt;/sensor-group-id&gt;     &lt;config&gt;      &lt;sensor-group-id&gt;SGroup3&lt;/sensor-group-id&gt;     &lt;/config&gt;     &lt;sensor-paths&gt;      &lt;sensor-path&gt;       &lt;path&gt;openconfig-interfaces#interfaces/interface&lt;/path&gt;       &lt;config&gt;        &lt;path&gt;openconfig-interfaces#interfaces/interface&lt;/path&gt;       &lt;/config&gt;      &lt;/sensor-path&gt;     &lt;/sensor-paths&gt;    &lt;/sensor-group&gt;   &lt;/sensor-groups&gt;   &lt;subscriptions&gt;    &lt;persistent&gt;     &lt;subscription&gt;      &lt;subscription-id&gt;Sub3&lt;/subscription-id&gt;      &lt;config&gt;       &lt;subscription-id&gt;Sub3&lt;/subscription-id&gt;      &lt;/config&gt;      &lt;sensor-profiles&gt;       &lt;sensor-profile&gt;        &lt;sensor-group&gt;SGroup3&lt;/sensor-group&gt;        &lt;config&gt;         &lt;sensor-group&gt;SGroup3&lt;/sensor-group&gt;         &lt;sample-interval&gt;30000&lt;/sample-interval&gt;        &lt;/config&gt;       &lt;/sensor-profile&gt;      &lt;/sensor-profiles&gt;     &lt;/subscription&gt;    &lt;/persistent&gt;   &lt;/subscriptions&gt;  &lt;/telemetry-system&gt; &lt;/data&gt;&lt;/rpc-reply&gt;So what does all that mean to the router?  It breaks down into three parts which you’ll recall from the YANG model above#  The destination-group tells the router where to send telemetry data and how.  The absence of a destination-group in the output above alerts us to the fact that this is a dial-in configuration (the collector will initiate the session to the router).  The sensor-group identifies a list of YANG models that the router should stream.  In this case, the router has a sensor-group called “SGroup3” that will send interface statistics data from the OpenConfig Interfaces YANG model.  The subscription ties together the destination-group and the sensor-group.  This router has a subscription name “Sub3” that will send the list of models in SGroup3 at an interval of 30 second (30000 milleseconds).If you read the earlier tutorial on configuring MDT with CLI, you might recognize this as the same as the gRPC dial-in configuration described there.  If you missed that thrilling installment, the XML above is the YANG equivalent of this CLI#CLI Output#telemetry model-driven sensor-group SGroup3  sensor-path openconfig-interfaces#interfaces/interface ! subscription Sub3  sensor-group-id SGroup3 sample-interval 30000 !  Edit-ConfigSo let’s say we want to add a second model to SGroup3 (Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-arp-oper).  We can do that with the following NETCONF operations#edit_data = '''&lt;config&gt;&lt;telemetry-system xmlns=~http#//openconfig.net/yang/telemetry~&gt;   &lt;sensor-groups&gt;    &lt;sensor-group&gt;     &lt;sensor-group-id&gt;SGroup3&lt;/sensor-group-id&gt;     &lt;sensor-paths&gt;      &lt;sensor-path&gt;       &lt;config&gt;        &lt;path&gt;Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-arp-oper#arp/nodes/node/entries/entry&lt;/path&gt;       &lt;/config&gt;      &lt;/sensor-path&gt;     &lt;/sensor-paths&gt;    &lt;/sensor-group&gt;   &lt;/sensor-groups&gt;&lt;/config&gt;'''xr.edit_config(edit_data, target='candidate', format='xml')xr.commit()If we do a get-config operation again#c = xr.get_config(source='running', filter=('subtree', filter))print(c)… we’ll see that SGroup3 has the new addition.Script Output#&lt;?xml version=~1.0~?&gt;&lt;rpc-reply message-id=~urn#uuid#abd0a7ee-5f06-4754-b2a3-dae6e3d797aa~ xmlns#nc=~urn#ietf#params#xml#ns#netconf#base#1.0~ xmlns=~urn#ietf#params#xml#ns#netconf#base#1.0~&gt; &lt;data&gt;  &lt;telemetry-system xmlns=~http#//openconfig.net/yang/telemetry~&gt;   &lt;sensor-groups&gt;    &lt;sensor-group&gt;     &lt;sensor-group-id&gt;SGroup3&lt;/sensor-group-id&gt;     &lt;config&gt;      &lt;sensor-group-id&gt;SGroup3&lt;/sensor-group-id&gt;     &lt;/config&gt;     &lt;sensor-paths&gt;      &lt;sensor-path&gt;       &lt;path&gt;openconfig-interfaces#interfaces/interface&lt;/path&gt;       &lt;config&gt;        &lt;path&gt;openconfig-interfaces#interfaces/interface&lt;/path&gt;       &lt;/config&gt;      &lt;/sensor-path&gt;      &lt;sensor-path&gt;       &lt;path&gt;Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-arp-oper#arp/nodes/node/entries/entry&lt;/path&gt;       &lt;config&gt;        &lt;path&gt;Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-arp-oper#arp/nodes/node/entries/entry&lt;/path&gt;       &lt;/config&gt;      &lt;/sensor-path&gt;     &lt;/sensor-paths&gt;    &lt;/sensor-group&gt;   &lt;/sensor-groups&gt;   &lt;subscriptions&gt;    &lt;persistent&gt;     &lt;subscription&gt;      &lt;subscription-id&gt;Sub3&lt;/subscription-id&gt;      &lt;config&gt;       &lt;subscription-id&gt;Sub3&lt;/subscription-id&gt;      &lt;/config&gt;      &lt;sensor-profiles&gt;       &lt;sensor-profile&gt;        &lt;sensor-group&gt;SGroup3&lt;/sensor-group&gt;        &lt;config&gt;         &lt;sensor-group&gt;SGroup3&lt;/sensor-group&gt;         &lt;sample-interval&gt;30000&lt;/sample-interval&gt;        &lt;/config&gt;       &lt;/sensor-profile&gt;      &lt;/sensor-profiles&gt;     &lt;/subscription&gt;    &lt;/persistent&gt;   &lt;/subscriptions&gt;  &lt;/telemetry-system&gt; &lt;/data&gt;&lt;/rpc-reply&gt;And if you need some CLI to reassure yourself that it worked, here it is#CLI Output#RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#show run telemetry model-drivenMon Aug  8 20#09#57.149 UTCtelemetry model-driven sensor-group SGroup3  sensor-path openconfig-interfaces#interfaces/interface  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-arp-oper#arp/nodes/node/entries/entry ! subscription Sub3  sensor-group-id SGroup3 sample-interval 30000 !!ConclusionArmed with the examples in this blog and a understanding of the telemetry YANG model, you should now be able to use YANG configuration models to configure the router to stream YANG models with the operational data you want.  How’s that for model-driven programmability?",

      "content": "     Configuring MDT with YDK  YDK# Automating YANG without XML  Connect to the router  Define the sensor group  Apply the SensorGroup object to the router  Instantiate a Subscription object and apply it  What did all that code do?  Clean up, clean up, everybody clean up!  Conclusion  YDK# Automating YANG without XMLIn an earlier tutorial, I wrote about how to configure MDT using the OpenConfig Telemetry YANG model with ncclient and a lot of XML.  An even simpler way to do this is to use YDK, a developer toolkit that automatically generates APIs directly from YANG models.  The Python classes that are generated by YDK mirror the YANG model hierarchy. So if you know some Python and you understand the YANG model, you can start writing code, no knowledge of NETCONF or XML required.In this blog, I’ll explain how to configure telemetry for gRPC dialin using YDK and the OpenConfig Telemetry YANG model.Connect to the routerYDK leverages ncclient to handle the NETCONF connection, so this bit of code might look similar to what you’ve done before, using the YDK provider library instead of ncclient#from ydk.providers import NetconfServiceProviderfrom ydk.services import CRUDServiceHOST = '10.30.111.9'PORT = 830USER = 'cisco'PASS = 'cisco'xr = NetconfServiceProvider(address=HOST,\tport=PORT,\tusername=USER,\tpassword=PASS,\tprotocol = 'ssh')With that, we are now connected to the router#CLI Output#RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#show netconf-yang clientsMon Aug  8 23#01#48.210 UTCNetconf clientsclient session ID|     NC version|    client connect time|        last OP time|        last OP type|    &lt;lock&gt;|       1386485520|            1.1|         0d  0h  0m  5s|                    |                    |        No|RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#Define the sensor groupNow that our script is connected to the router, we’ll start by defining the sensor-group.  Here’s the first bit of YDK for that#import ydk.models.openconfig.openconfig_telemetry as oc_telemetrysgroup = oc_telemetry.TelemetrySystem.SensorGroups.SensorGroup()sgroup.sensor_group_id=~SGroup4~sgroup.config.sensor_group_id=~SGroup4~So how did I come up with that?  Look back at the first part of the OC Telemetry YANG model#PYANG Output#module# openconfig-telemetry   +--rw telemetry-system      +--rw sensor-groups      |  +--rw sensor-group* [sensor-group-id]      |     +--rw sensor-group-id    -&gt; ../config/sensor-group-id      |     +--rw config      |     |  +--rw sensor-group-id?   stringStart from the top and walk down from telemetry-system to sensor-groups to sensor-group.  Replace the dashes and lowercase syntax with CamelCase syntax and you get the class that instantiates that first object# TelemetrySystem.SensorGroups.SensorGroup().  Down to the next level, we have the leaf “sensor-group-id.”  YDK converts this to an object attribute by replacing the hyphens with underscores.  The sensor-group-id list key is actually a leaf-ref to config/sensor-group-id, both of which are required (hence the two lines that seem redundant but are actually required for syntactic validation because of the structure of the YANG model).Going down a little farther in the YANG model with some help from some pyang options, we see that the sensor-group contains a list of sensor-paths.PYANG Output#$ pyang -f tree openconfig-telemetry.yang --tree-path=telemetry-system/sensor-groups/sensor-group/sensor-paths/sensor-path/configmodule# openconfig-telemetry   +--rw telemetry-system      +--rw sensor-groups         +--rw sensor-group* [sensor-group-id]            +--rw sensor-paths               +--rw sensor-path* [path]                  +--rw config                     +--rw path?             string$This is how that maps to YDK code#sgroup.sensor_paths = sgroup.SensorPaths()new_sensorpath = sgroup.SensorPaths.SensorPath()new_sensorpath.path = 'Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics%2finterfaces%2finterface%2flatest%2fgeneric-counters'new_sensorpath.config.path = 'Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics%2finterfaces%2finterface%2flatest%2fgeneric-counters'sgroup.sensor_paths.sensor_path.append(new_sensorpath)So again, following the YANG model, we define the top-level SensorPaths object, then a SensorPath with an object attribute “path” that actually specifies the YANG model that we want to stream (in this case, our old friend, interface statistics).Note that the “%2f” in the path attributes represent URL encodings of the forward slash character (“/”).  The code would look a little better if you used a utility such as urllib to do the string substitution for you, so you can use the more natural looking path with “/” characters like this#import urllibsgroup.sensor_paths = sgroup.SensorPaths()new_sensorpath = sgroup.SensorPaths.SensorPath()interface_stats_path = urllib.quote('Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters', safe='#')new_sensorpath.path = interface_stats_pathnew_sensorpath.config.path = interface_stats_pathsgroup.sensor_paths.sensor_path.append(new_sensorpath)Apply the SensorGroup object to the routerOnce you’ve populated the object, it’s trivial to apply it to the router using the create method on the CRUDService object from YDK#from ydk.services import CRUDServicerpc_service = CRUDService()rpc_service.create(xr, sgroup)Instantiate a Subscription object and apply itThe Subscription is the final piece of the config.  Again, refer to the YANG model to understand the Python class that you should use.  I’ll use pyang with the tree-path option to make it clearer#PYANG Output#$pyang -f tree --tree-path telemetry-system/subscriptions/persistent/subscription/sensor-profiles/sensor-profile openconfig-telemetry.yangmodule# openconfig-telemetry   +--rw telemetry-system      +--rw subscriptions         +--rw persistent            +--rw subscription* [subscription-id]               +--rw sensor-profiles                  +--rw sensor-profile* [sensor-group]                     +--rw sensor-group    -&gt; ../config/sensor-group                     +--rw config                     |  +--rw sensor-group?         -&gt; /telemetry-system/sensor-groups/sensor-group/config/sensor-group-id                     |  +--rw sample-interval?      uint64                     |  +--rw heartbeat-interval?   uint64                     |  +--rw suppress-redundant?   boolean                     +--ro state                        +--ro sensor-group?         -&gt; /telemetry-system/sensor-groups/sensor-group/config/sensor-group-id                        +--ro sample-interval?      uint64                        +--ro heartbeat-interval?   uint64                        +--ro suppress-redundant?   booleanThis is how that ends up in YDK code#sub = oc_telemetry.TelemetrySystem.Subscriptions.Persistent.Subscription()sub.subscription_id = 4sub.config.subscription_id = 4sub.sensor_profiles = sub.SensorProfiles()new_sgroup = sub.SensorProfiles.SensorProfile()new_sgroup.sensor_group = 'SGroup4'new_sgroup.config.sensor_group = 'SGroup4'new_sgroup.config.sample_interval = 30000sub.sensor_profiles.sensor_profile.append(new_sgroup)rpc_service.create(xr, sub)What did all that code do?So this is how all that shows up in CLI#CLI Output#RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#show run telemetry model-drivenTue Aug  9 17#52#38.462 UTCtelemetry model-driven sensor-group SGroup4  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters ! subscription 4  sensor-group-id SGroup4 sample-interval 30000 !!RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#And that is all you need for Model-Driven Telemetry using gRPC dialin.Clean up, clean up, everybody clean up!Need to delete the telemetry config completely?  Here’s how#rpc_service.delete(xr, oc_telemetry.TelemetrySystem())ConclusionIn this tutorial, we looked at a couple dozen lines of YDK code that added and then removed five lines of CLI.  So you might be thinking “and that helps me be more efficient…how?”  But the power of automation in general and YDK in particular can’t be fully revealed in a single, simple example like this.  The real power of YDK is that it allows you to do this for any YANG model on the box, automatically generating Python classes that inherit the syntactic checks and requirements of the underlying model, while also handling all the details of the underlying encoding and transport (no understanding of XML or NETCONF chunk framing required!).

I will use ncclient as a simple Python NETCONF client, but you can use whatever client you want.The ModelThe Cisco IOS XR Native YANG model for telemetry is “Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-cfg.”  It can be used to configure any telemetry feature that IOS XR (unlike the OpenConfig telemetry model, which only covers a subset of IOS XR capabilities).The NETCONF &lt;get-schema&gt; operation will give you the contents of the schema but the full YANG output can be really verbose and overwhelming, so I’ll pipe the output to the pyang utility for a compact tree view with the following bit of code#from ncclient import managerimport re    xr = manager.connect(host='10.30.111.9', port=830, username='cisco', password='cisco',                    allow_agent=False,                    look_for_keys=False,                    hostkey_verify=False,                    unknown_host_cb=True)                    from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUToc = xr.get_schema('Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-cfg')p = Popen(['pyang', '-f', 'tree'], stdout=PIPE, stdin=PIPE, stderr=PIPE) print(p.communicate(input=oc.data)[0])And voila#Script Output#module# Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-cfg   +--rw telemetry-model-driven      +--rw sensor-groups      |  +--rw sensor-group* [sensor-group-identifier]      |     +--rw sensor-paths      |     |  +--rw sensor-path* [telemetry-sensor-path]      |     |     +--rw telemetry-sensor-path    string      |     +--rw enable?                    empty      |     +--rw sensor-group-identifier    xr#Cisco-ios-xr-string      +--rw subscriptions      |  +--rw subscription* [subscription-identifier]      |     +--rw source-address!      |     |  +--rw address-family    Af      |     |  +--rw ip-address?       inet#ipv4-address-no-zone      |     |  +--rw ipv6-address?     string      |     +--rw sensor-profiles      |     |  +--rw sensor-profile* [sensorgroupid]      |     |     +--rw sample-interval?      uint32      |     |     +--rw heartbeat-interval?   uint32      |     |     +--rw supress-redundant?    empty      |     |     +--rw sensorgroupid         xr#Cisco-ios-xr-string      |     +--rw destination-profiles      |     |  +--rw destination-profile* [destination-id]      |     |     +--rw enable?           empty      |     |     +--rw destination-id    xr#Cisco-ios-xr-string      |     +--rw source-qos-marking?        uint32      |     +--rw subscription-identifier    xr#Cisco-ios-xr-string      +--rw destination-groups      |  +--rw destination-group* [destination-id]      |     +--rw destinations      |     |  +--rw destination* [address-family]      |     |     +--rw address-family    Af      |     |     +--rw ipv4* [ipv4-address destination-port]      |     |     |  +--rw ipv4-address        inet#ip-address-no-zone      |     |     |  +--rw destination-port    xr#Cisco-ios-xr-port-number      |     |     |  +--rw protocol!      |     |     |  |  +--rw protocol        Proto-type      |     |     |  |  +--rw tls-hostname?   string      |     |     |  |  +--rw no-tls?         int32      |     |     |  +--rw encoding?

Only needed for dial-out configuration.        The sensor-group identifies a list of YANG models that the router should stream.        The subscription ties together the destination-group and the sensor-group.  Let’s see how this works in practice.Get-ConfigWe can use the openconfig-telemetry model to filter for the telemetry config with the ncclient get_config operation. Continuing our python script from above#xr_filter = '''&lt;telemetry-model-driven xmlns=~http#//cisco.com/ns/yang/Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-cfg~&gt;'''c = xr.get_config(source='running', filter=('subtree', xr_filter))print(c)And here’s what we get#Script Output#&lt;?xml version=~1.0~?&gt;&lt;rpc-reply message-id=~urn#uuid#1ddd326c-e2c8-46b1-8433-11283799b9ce~ xmlns#nc=~urn#ietf#params#xml#ns#netconf#base#1.0~ xmlns=~urn#ietf#params#xml#ns#netconf#base#1.0~&gt; &lt;data&gt;  &lt;telemetry-model-driven xmlns=~http#//cisco.com/ns/yang/Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-cfg~&gt;   &lt;destination-groups&gt;    &lt;destination-group&gt;     &lt;destination-id&gt;DGroup1&lt;/destination-id&gt;     &lt;destinations&gt;      &lt;destination&gt;       &lt;address-family&gt;ipv4&lt;/address-family&gt;       &lt;ipv4&gt;        &lt;ipv4-address&gt;172.30.8.4&lt;/ipv4-address&gt;        &lt;destination-port&gt;5432&lt;/destination-port&gt;        &lt;encoding&gt;self-describing-gpb&lt;/encoding&gt;        &lt;protocol&gt;         &lt;protocol&gt;tcp&lt;/protocol&gt;         &lt;tls-hostname&gt;&lt;/tls-hostname&gt;         &lt;no-tls&gt;0&lt;/no-tls&gt;        &lt;/protocol&gt;       &lt;/ipv4&gt;      &lt;/destination&gt;     &lt;/destinations&gt;    &lt;/destination-group&gt;   &lt;/destination-groups&gt;   &lt;sensor-groups&gt;    &lt;sensor-group&gt;     &lt;sensor-group-identifier&gt;SGroup1&lt;/sensor-group-identifier&gt;     &lt;enable&gt;&lt;/enable&gt;     &lt;sensor-paths&gt;      &lt;sensor-path&gt;       &lt;telemetry-sensor-path&gt;Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters&lt;/telemetry-sensor-path&gt;      &lt;/sensor-path&gt;     &lt;/sensor-paths&gt;    &lt;/sensor-group&gt;   &lt;/sensor-groups&gt;   &lt;enable&gt;&lt;/enable&gt;   &lt;subscriptions&gt;    &lt;subscription&gt;     &lt;subscription-identifier&gt;Sub1&lt;/subscription-identifier&gt;     &lt;sensor-profiles&gt;      &lt;sensor-profile&gt;       &lt;sensorgroupid&gt;SGroup1&lt;/sensorgroupid&gt;       &lt;sample-interval&gt;30000&lt;/sample-interval&gt;      &lt;/sensor-profile&gt;     &lt;/sensor-profiles&gt;     &lt;destination-profiles&gt;      &lt;destination-profile&gt;       &lt;destination-id&gt;DGroup1&lt;/destination-id&gt;       &lt;enable&gt;&lt;/enable&gt;      &lt;/destination-profile&gt;     &lt;/destination-profiles&gt;    &lt;/subscription&gt;   &lt;/subscriptions&gt;  &lt;/telemetry-model-driven&gt; &lt;/data&gt;&lt;/rpc-reply&gt;So what does all that mean to the router?  It breaks down into three parts which you’ll recall from the YANG model above#      The destination-group tells the router where to send telemetry data and how.  The destination group in this configuration (“DGroup1”) will send telemetry data to an IPv4 address (172.30.8.4) on port 5432 with a self-describing GPB encoding via TCP.        The sensor-group identifies a list of YANG models that the router should stream.  In this case, the router has a sensor-group called “SGroup1” that will send interface statistics data from the IOS XR Native YANG model for interface stats.        The subscription ties together the destination-group and the sensor-group.  This router has a subscription name “Sub1” that will send the list of models in SGroup1 to DGroup1 at an interval of 30 second (30000 milleseconds).  If you read the earlier tutorial on configuring MDT with CLI, you might recognize this as the same as the TCP dial-out configuration described there.  If you missed that thrilling installment, the XML above is the YANG equivalent of this CLI#CLI Output#telemetry model-driven   destination-group DGroup1     address family ipv4 172.30.8.4 port 5432     encoding self-describing-gpb     protocol tcp  ! ! sensor-group SGroup1  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters !   subscription Sub1    sensor-group-id SGroup1 sample-interval 30000    destination-id DGroup1 Edit-ConfigSo let’s say we want to add a second model (Cisco-IOS-XR-wdsysmon-fd-oper) to SGroup1 to stream cpu utilization data.  We can do that with the following NETCONF operations#edit_data = '''&lt;config&gt;&lt;telemetry-model-driven xmlns=~http#//cisco.com/ns/yang/Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-cfg~&gt;   &lt;sensor-groups&gt;    &lt;sensor-group&gt;     &lt;sensor-group-identifier&gt;SGroup1&lt;/sensor-group-identifier&gt;     &lt;sensor-paths&gt;      &lt;sensor-path&gt;       &lt;telemetry-sensor-path&gt;Cisco-IOS-XR-wdsysmon-fd-oper#system-monitoring&lt;/telemetry-sensor-path&gt;      &lt;/sensor-path&gt;     &lt;/sensor-paths&gt;    &lt;/sensor-group&gt;   &lt;/sensor-groups&gt;  &lt;/telemetry-model-driven&gt;&lt;/config&gt;'''xr.edit_config(edit_data, target='candidate', format='xml')xr.commit()If we do a get-config operation again, this time filtering on just the sensor-groups#xr_filter = '''&lt;telemetry-model-driven xmlns=~http#//cisco.com/ns/yang/Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-cfg~&gt;&lt;sensor-groups&gt;'''c = xr.get_config(source='running', filter=('subtree', xr_filter))print(c)… we’ll see that SGroup1 has the new sensor-path.Script Output#&lt;?xml version=~1.0~?&gt;&lt;rpc-reply message-id=~urn#uuid#dbcef1db-83af-43f0-b2fe-153c53fc1f82~ xmlns#nc=~urn#ietf#params#xml#ns#netconf#base#1.0~ xmlns=~urn#ietf#params#xml#ns#netconf#base#1.0~&gt; &lt;data&gt;  &lt;telemetry-model-driven xmlns=~http#//cisco.com/ns/yang/Cisco-IOS-XR-telemetry-model-driven-cfg~&gt;   &lt;sensor-groups&gt;    &lt;sensor-group&gt;     &lt;sensor-group-identifier&gt;SGroup1&lt;/sensor-group-identifier&gt;     &lt;enable&gt;&lt;/enable&gt;     &lt;sensor-paths&gt;      &lt;sensor-path&gt;       &lt;telemetry-sensor-path&gt;Cisco-IOS-XR-wdsysmon-fd-oper#system-monitoring&lt;/telemetry-sensor-path&gt;      &lt;/sensor-path&gt;      &lt;sensor-path&gt;       &lt;telemetry-sensor-path&gt;Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters&lt;/telemetry-sensor-path&gt;      &lt;/sensor-path&gt;     &lt;/sensor-paths&gt;    &lt;/sensor-group&gt;   &lt;/sensor-groups&gt;  &lt;/telemetry-model-driven&gt; &lt;/data&gt;&lt;/rpc-reply&gt;Now let’s add an IPv6 destination to DGroup1 using gRPC dial-out and self-describing GPB encoding.

Using PipelineIn an earlier blog, I introduced Pipeline, a multi-function telemetry collection service written in Go.  In this tutorial, I’ll cover how to set up Pipeline for the simplest of tasks#  ingesting telemetry data over TCP and writing it to a file as a JSON object.Preparing the RouterThis tutorial assumes that you’ve already configured your router for model-driven telemetry (MDT) with TCP dial-out using the instructions in this tutorial. The IP address and port that you specify in the destination-group in the router config should match the IP address and port on which Pipeline is listening.Getting PipelinePipeline is available from github.Pipeline.confThe pipeline.conf file contains all the configuration necessary to get Pipeline running.  In many cases, the default pipeline.conf can be used with little or no modification.The pipeline configuration is divided up into sections.  Each section is delineated by an arbitrary name enclosed in square brackets.  Each section defines either an input stage (“stage = xport_input”) or an output stage (“stage = export_output”).  Other parameters in the section tell Pipeline what to listen for (in the case of an input stage) or how to output the data (for an output stage).The easiest way to understand this is to look at a simple example.Configuring the Input Stage for TCP Dial-OutLet’s take a look at the TCP dial-out section in the default pipeline.conf.scadora@darcy#~/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline$ grep -A20 ~Example of a TCP dialout~ pipeline.conf# Example of a TCP dialout (router connects to pipeline over TCP)#[testbed]stage = xport_input## Module type, the type dictates the rest of the options in the section.# TCP can only be used as xport_iinput currently. UDP works similarly.#type = tcp## Supported encapsulation is 'st' for streaming telemetry header. This# is the header used to carry streaming telemetry payload in TCP and UDP.#encap = st## TCP option dictating which binding to listen on. Can be a host name# or address and port, or just port.#listen = #5432This [testbed] section shown above will work “as is” for MDT with TCP dial-out.  If you want to change the port that Pipeline listens on to something other than “5432”, you can edit this section of the pipeline.conf.  Otherwise, we’re good to go for the input stage.Configuring the Output Stage for Text FileTo dump the received data to a file, we need a “tap” stage in Pipeline.  The default pipeline.conf file comes with a tap stage section called [inspector] as you can see below.scadora@darcy#~/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline$ grep -A20 ~Example of a tap stage~ pipeline.conf# Example of a tap stage; dump content to file, or at least count messages#[inspector]stage = xport_output## Module type# tap is only supported in xport_output stage currently.#type = tap## File to dump decoded messages#file = /data/dump.txt## encoding = json#This [inspector] section shown above will work “as is” for dumping data to a file.  If you want to change the file that Pipeline writes to (default is /data/dump.txt) or write with a different encoding (default is JSON), you can edit this section of the pipeline.conf.  Otherwise, we’re good to go for the output stage as well.Running PipelineRunning pipeline is trivial.  Just execute the binary in the bin directory.  Pipeline will use the pipeline.conf file by default.scadora@darcy#~/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline$ bin/pipeline &amp;[1] 21975scadora@darcy#~/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline$ Startup pipelineLoad config from [pipeline.conf], logging in [pipeline.log]Wait for ^C to shutdownscadora@darcy#~/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline$Seeing the DataAssuming your router is properly configured, the router should initiate the TCP session to Pipeline and stream the data specified in the sensor-group configuration.  To see the data as it comes in, use the Linux “tail” utility on the file that the [inspector] stage was configured to write to.scadora@darcy#~/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline$ tail -f dump.txt------- 2017-04-03 20#37#06.763244782 -0700 PDT -------Summary# GPB(common) Message [172.30.8.53#15457(SunC)/Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters msg len# 5984]{    ~Source~# ~172.30.8.53#15457~,    ~Telemetry~# {        ~node_id_str~# ~SunC~,        ~subscription_id_str~# ~Sub1~,        ~encoding_path~# ~Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters~,        ~collection_id~# 712163,        ~collection_start_time~# 1491277026499,        ~msg_timestamp~# 1491277026499,        ~collection_end_time~# 1491277026507    },    ~Rows~# [        {               ~Timestamp~# 1491277026506,            ~Keys~# {                ~interface-name~# ~MgmtEth0/RP0/CPU0/0~            },            ~Content~# {                ~applique~# 0,                ~availability-flag~# 0,                ~broadcast-packets-received~# 65679,                ~broadcast-packets-sent~# 0,                ~bytes-received~# 272894774,                ~bytes-sent~# 20829696017,                ~carrier-transitions~# 1,                &lt;output snipped for brevity&gt;Why Did We Do That Again?To leverage the real power of telemetry, you need to get the data into an analytics stack like InfluxDB or Prometheus…or to multiple consumers via a pub/sub mechanism like Kafka.  Pipeline can do all that and I’ll show you how in future tutorials.But having the power to dump encoded telemetry data into a text file does come in handy, especially when you’re setting up telemetry and Pipeline for the first time.  The tap output module gives you a quick and easy way to validate that the router is sending the data you think it should be sending.  Once that’s settled, it’s a simple matter of configuring a different output module to send the data some place really useful.Give Pipeline a try and let us know what you think!",

In this tutorial, I’ll describe the Pipeline configuration that enables you to write telemetry data into InfluxDB, an open source platform for time-series data.Here’s a picture of what we are trying to do#Pipeline and InfluxDB can run on the same server or on different servers, as long as there is connectivity between them.Preparing the RouterThis tutorial assumes that you’ve already configured your router for model-driven telemetry (MDT) with TCP dial-out using the instructions in this tutorial. The IP address and port that you specify in the destination-group in the router config should match the IP address and port on which Pipeline is listening.Getting InfluxdbThis tutorial assumes that you have a working instance of InfluxDB with an IP address that is accessible from your Pipeline instance and has a database named “mdt_db”.   If you want to use a different database name, edit the pipeline.conf output stage configuration below.InfluxDB is available from github and includes documentation on creating databases.  InfluxDB is also available as a Docker container.Getting PipelinePipeline is available from github.Pipeline.confConfiguring the Input Stage for TCP Dial-OutFor this tutorial, I’ll use the default pipeline.conf input stage for MDT TCP Dial-Out described in the TCP to Textfile tutorial.  If you take out all the comments, this reduces to 5 lines in pipeline.conf#[testbed]stage = xport_inputtype = tcpencap = stlisten = #5432This [testbed] section shown above will work “as is” for MDT with TCP dial-out.  If you want to change the port that Pipeline listens on to something other than “5432”, you can edit this section of the pipeline.conf.  Otherwise, we’re good to go for the input stage.Configuring the Output Stage for InfluxDBTo push the data to InfluxDB, we need a “metrics” output stage in Pipeline.  The default pipeline.conf file comes with an example metrics stage section called [mymetrics].  Taking out the comments, the important lines are as follows#[mymetrics]stage = xport_outputtype = metricsfile = metrics.jsondump = metricsdump.txtoutput = influxinflux = http#//10.152.176.74#8086database = mdt_dbThis configuration instructs Pipeline to post MDT data to an InfluxDB instance at 10.152.176.74#8086 that has a database named mdt_db.Before posting the data to influxdb, pipeline transforms the data according to the instructions in the metrics.json file.  More on this in the next section.Finally, the dump = metricsdump.txt option lets you locally dump a copy of the same data that is being pushed to influxdb.  This is useful for first-time setup and debugging.Using metrics.jsonTL;DR If you are using the sensor-path from the TCP to Textfile tutorial and the default metrics.json, you actually have nothing to do.  But if you have a burning desire to know how things works, please read the rest of the section!YANG models define data hierarchies.  Because MDT is based on YANG models, the raw telemetry data from a router is also hierarchical.  Time-series databases, however, typically expect data in a simple format# metric name, metric value, timestamp and, optionally, some tags or keys.  In influxdb, this format is called the “Line Protocol.”One of the important functions of Pipeline is to take the hierarchical YANG-based data and transform it into the Line Protocol for easy consumption by influxdb.  Pipeline takes the complex, hierarchical YANG-modeled data and flattens it into multiple time series.  Pipeline uses the metrics.json file to perform the transformation. The metrics.json file contains a series of json objects, one for each YANG model and sub-tree path that the router streams.Take the sensor-path configured on the router in the TCP Dial Out Tutorial# Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters.  The corresponding object in the default metrics.json is below#{\t\t~basepath~ # ~Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counters~,\t\t~spec~ # {\t\t\t~fields~ # [\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~interface-name~, ~tag~ # true},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~packets-received~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~bytes-received~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~packets-sent~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~bytes-sent~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~output-drops~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~output-queue-drops~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~input-drops~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~input-queue-drops~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~input-errors~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~crc-errors~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~input-ignored-packets~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~output-errors~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~output-buffer-failures~},\t\t\t\t{~name~ # ~carrier-transitions~}\t\t\t]\t\t}\t}This entry in the metrics.json file enables Pipeline to post interface statistics in the influxdb Line Protocol with the following characteristics#Measurement#  Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-countersTag Names and Values  EncodingPath=Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-statsd-oper#infra-statistics/interfaces/interface/latest/generic-counter  Producer=SunC  interface-name=MgmtEth0/RP0/CPU0/0Field Keys and Values  bytes-received=307428735  bytes-sent=23017070265        Timestamp  1491942788950000000You might have noticed that “interface-name” is one of the Tag Names, not a Field Key above. There are two ways to get an MDT metric marked as a Tag.  First, recall that the router sends MDT data as one of two types# Keys and Content.  Pipeline will automatically translate items in the MDT Keys section to a Tag.  You can also use the metrics.json file.  Any entry in the metrics.json file with ~tag~ # true will be added to the Tag Names in the Line Protocol and not sent as a Field Key.Also good to know# if you don’t have an entry in the metrics.json file, then that data point will not be posted to InfluxDB, even if the router sends that data to Pipeline.  That’s actually a feature!  Because bulk data collection is more efficient for the router, the router streams data at the container level of the YANG model.  That means you will sometimes receive more data than you actually need.  Pipeline gives you the ability to filter what data gets passed on to your time series database.Final takeaway, if the path you are streaming is already described in the metrics.json and has all the fields you care about (as is this case here), there is nothing to do.  Adding objects to the metrics.json will be the topic of a future tutorial.Running PipelineRun pipeline as usual, by executing the binary in the bin directory. Pipeline will use the pipeline.conf file by default.  Pipeline will prompt you for credentials to use when posting to influxdb.scadora@darcy#~/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline$ bin/pipelineStartup pipelineLoad config from [pipeline.conf], logging in [pipeline.log]CRYPT Client [mymetrics],[http#//10.152.176.84#8086] Enter username# admin Enter password#Wait for ^C to shutdownPower users will appreciate the -log= -debug option for pipeline#scadora@darcy#~/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline$ bin/pipeline -log= -debugINFO[2017-04-12 14#41#05.038501] Conductor says hello, loading config          config=pipeline.conf debug=true fluentd= logfile= maxthreads=1 tag=pipeline version=~v1.0.0(bigmuddy)~DEBU[2017-04-12 14#41#05.039562] Conductor processing section...               name=conductor section=inspector tag=pipelineDEBU[2017-04-12 14#41#05.039690] Conductor processing section, type...         name=conductor section=inspector tag=pipeline type=tapINFO[2017-04-12 14#41#05.039800] Conductor starting up section                 name=conductor section=inspector stage=~xport_output~ tag=pipelineDEBU[2017-04-12 14#41#05.039887] Conductor processing section...               name=conductor section=mymetrics tag=pipelineDEBU[2017-04-12 14#41#05.039940] Conductor processing section, type...         name=conductor section=mymetrics tag=pipeline type=metricsINFO[2017-04-12 14#41#05.039982] Conductor starting up section                 name=conductor section=mymetrics stage=~xport_output~ tag=pipeline&lt;output snipped for brevity&gt;Seeing the Data Before It Goes To InfluxDBSince we configure a “dump” file in the [mymetrics] output stage above, Pipeline will dump a local copy of the data it posts to InfluxDB into a text file in the Line Protocol format.

      "content": "     MDT with gRPC# Transport Tricks  gRPC  What is gRPC again?  What Does gRPC see?  Just Tell Me How to Fix It  I Didn’t Configure TPA But It Still Works, So There!  Conclusion  gRPCIn previous tutorials, I’ve covered how to configure a router for Model-Driven Telemetry (MDT) with gRPC dial-out and dial-in.  In this tutorial, I’ll discuss some advanced topics and gotchas that you might encounter as you work with gRPC.Note that you may not need to read this blog!  It is entirely likely that your gRPC connection will “just work.”  But for the few corner cases where it doesn’t, you might have to read this.  For example, if you can get TCP dial-out to work but not gRPC dial-out, keep reading…What is gRPC again?gRPC is an open source RPC framework that leverages HTTP/2 as a transport.  Compared to simple TCP transport, gRPC brings two important features to MDT# 1) Optional encryption with TLS and 2) Support for “dial-in” (from collector to router).Now bear with me for a moment, as this next bit get a little complicated.  If you are familiar with the 64 bit IOS XR software architecture, you may already be aware that IOS XR runs in a container on top of a Linux kernel.  The gRPC server used by MDT lives in the IOS XR container (it’s part of the IOS XR Linux shell) but it is not part of the XR Control Plane proper.  This means that gRPC uses the Linux networking stack (not the XR networking stack).  And this is where problems can happen.What Does gRPC see?To see the world from gRPC’s perspective, drop into the XR Linux shell and take a look at the routes there#RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#bashFri May  5 21#22#04.749 UTC[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#~]$netstat -rKernel IP routing tableDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface10.30.111.0     *               255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 Mg0_RP0_CPU0_0[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#~]$From this output, you can see that there is only a single route out the management interface.  If your gRPC collector lives on that subnet, the gRPC process will be able to find it.  So that’s one reason some lucky people don’t have to read this blog.  But if your collector is reachable through some other port, gRPC doesn’t know how to get there.  One symptom is that your subscription will stay in the dreaded “Not Active” state#RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#show telem model destination DGroup1 | include StateFri May  5 22#16#48.995 UTC    State#                Not ActiveIf you are doing gRPC dial-out, you will see this trace#RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#show grpc trace emsFri May  5 21#36#58.868 UTCMay  5 21#36#57.774 ems/grpc 0/RP0/CPU0 t19523 EMS-GRPC# grpc# Conn.resetTransport failed to create client transport# connection error# desc = ~transport# dial tcp 172.30.8.4#5432# connect# network is unreachable~; Reconnecting to ~172.30.8.4#5432~May  5 21#38#01.626 ems/grpc 0/RP0/CPU0 t13628 EMS-GRPC# Failed to dial 172.30.8.4#5432# grpc# timed out trying to connect; please retry.RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#Just Tell Me How to Fix ItOne way to fix this for both dial-in and dial-out is by configuring a Third-Party App (TPA) source address.  Configuring the TPA sets a src-hint for Linux applications, so that originating traffic from the applications can be tied to any reachable IP of XR.RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC(config)#tpa address-family ipv4 update-source GigabitEthernet 0/0/0/0By doing this, we automatically get a default route in the Linux shell (the fwdintf takes the traffic back to XR for routing)#[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#~]$netstat -rKernel IP routing tableDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Ifacedefault         *               0.0.0.0         U         0 0          0 fwdintf10.30.111.0     *               255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 Mg0_RP0_CPU0_0[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#~]$So now, gRPC has a route back to the collector.  That’s all you need for dial-in.For dial-out, gRPC now knows to use GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0 as a source address. You can see that here#[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#~]$ip routedefault dev fwdintf  scope link  src 172.30.8.5310.30.111.0/24 dev Mg0_RP0_CPU0_0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.30.111.9[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#~]$See that “src 172.30.8.53” ?  That’s the source address that gRPC will use when sending MDT traffic in dial-out mode.Note that you can use any operational interface for the update-source, with the exception of dot1q-tagged VLAN sub-interfaces (as of IOS XR 6.2).  If you’ve used update-source in other contexts (e.g. BGP neighbors configs), then you know that using a Loopback address is typically preferred since Loopbacks never goes down.  Just make sure that the Loopback you specify is return-path-routable from your collector!And speaking of Loopbacks…I Didn’t Configure TPA But It Still Works, So There!So some lucky people who didn’t configure TPA can still get gRPC to work!  Doesn’t seem fair, does it?  Well, the reason is that they have a Loopback (any Loopback except Loopback 1 which is reserved – gory detail fans read this).  When a Loopback interface is configured, you also get a default route in the Linux stack#RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC(config)#no tpaRP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC(config)#int loop0RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC(config-if)#ipv4 address 5.5.5.5/32RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC(config-if)#commitRP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC(config-if)#endRP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#bashFri May  5 22#01#59.141 UTC[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#~]$netstat -rKernel IP routing tableDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Ifacedefault         *               0.0.0.0         U         0 0          0 fwdintf10.30.111.0     *               255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 Mg0_RP0_CPU0_0That’s good for dial-in, but what about dial-out?  Well, it still might work.

If your collector has a route back to 5.5.5.5 (e.g. you’re distributing your loopback addresses in your IGP), then great.  If not, then the collector will drop the packet and you’ll need the TPA config for an interface IP address that is routable from the collector.ConclusionI hope you didn’t have to read this tutorial at all.  But if you did and even if you glazed over the bits about the Linux networking stack and XR Linux shell, just remember this# to make gRPC work, use a routable Loopback or TPA update-source.",

In each case, I configured the router to transport MDT data to Pipeline using TCP.  In this tutorial, I’ll cover a few additional steps that are required to use Pipeline with gRPC.  I’ll focus on only the changes needed in the router and Pipeline input stage configs here, so be sure to consult the other Pipeline tutorials for important info about install, output stage, etc.If you’re going to use gRPC, the first thing to decide is whether you’re going to dial out from the router or dial in to the router.If you don’t know the difference between dialin and dialout or need help chosing, check out my blog for some guidance.Once you’ve made that decision, go the appropriate section of this tutorial# gRPC Dialout or gRPC Dialin.  For each section, there will be some “common” router and Pipeline config setps and well as some specific steps you need depending on whether or not you enable TLS.gRPC DialoutFor gRPC Dialout, the subscription and sensor-group config are the same whether you use TLS or not, so I’ll re-use those parts of the MDT router config from the gRPC dialout example.  It will look like this#telemetry model-driven sensor-group SGroup2  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-nto-misc-oper#memory-summary/nodes/node/summary ! subscription Sub2  sensor-group-id SGroup2 sample-interval 30000  destination-id DGroup2Now the big decision is whether to use TLS or not. This impacts the destination-group in the router config and the ingress stage of the Pipeline input stage as you’ll see below.gRPC Dialout Without TLSIf you don’t use TLS, your MDT data won’t be encrypted.  On the other hand, it’s easy to configure. So if you’re new to MDT and gRPC, this might be a good starting place.Router Config# no-tlsThe gRPC config for the router is contained in the MDT destination-group.  Here is a destination-group for gRPC dialout without TLS#telemetry model-driven destination-group DGroup2  address family ipv4 172.30.8.4 port 57500   encoding self-describing-gpb   protocol grpc no-tlsAdd that to the subscription and sensor-path configuration in the commmon router config above and your router config for gRPC dialout without TLS is done.Pipeline.conf# tls = falseYou can use the [gRPCDIalout] input stage in the default pipeline.conf from github.

You’re done.  Telemetry data is streaming into pipeline and you can do with it what you want.  You can stop reading now unless you want to experiment with TLS.gRPC Dialout With TLSIn a dialout scenario, the router is the “client” and Pipeline is the “server.”  Therefore, in the TLS handshake, Pipeline will need to send a certificate to authenticate itself to the router.  The router validates Pipeline’s certificate using the public certificate of the Root Certificate Authority (CA) that signed it and then generates sesssion keys to encrypt the session.To make this all work, you need the following#  A Root CA certificate  A Pipeline certificate signed by the Root CA  A copy of the Root CA certificate on the routerFor the purpose of this tutorial, I will use openssl (an open-source TLS toolkit) for the root CA and Pipeline certificate.  If your organization has an existing PKI, you can skip the first two steps and just copy the Root CA certificate to the router.Certificates for TLS Dialout1. The rootCA Key and CertificateFor simplicity, I’ll generate the rootCA on the same server that I am running Pipeline.  First, create a rootCA key-pair (may require sudo)#scadora@darcy#/etc/ssl/certs$ openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus...........+++................................+++e is 65537 (0x10001)scadora@darcy#/etc/ssl/certs$Now use that key to self-sign the rootCA certificate.  It will ask you a bunch of questions that you can fill out as you want (I just used all defaults)#scadora@darcy#/etc/ssl/certs$ sudo openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -extensions v3_ca -config ../openssl.cnf -out rootCA.pem You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporatedinto your certificate request.What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blankFor some fields there will be a default value,If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.-----Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]#State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]#Locality Name (eg, city) []#Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]#Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []#Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []#Email Address []#scadora@darcy#/etc/ssl/certs$You should now have a rootCA certificate called rootCA.pem.2. The Pipeline CertificateFirst, create a key pair for Pipeline.  In this case, I’ve called it “darcy.key” since darcy is the name of the server on which I am running Pipeline.scadora@darcy#/etc/ssl/certs$  sudo openssl genrsa -out darcy.key 2048Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus................+++..+++e is 65537 (0x10001)scadora@darcy#/etc/ssl/certs$Next, create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using the key you just generated.  In the following, I use all the defaults except for the Common Name, which I set as darcy.cisco.com#scadora@darcy#/etc/ssl/certs$ openssl req -new -key darcy.key -out darcy.csrYou are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporatedinto your certificate request.What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blankFor some fields there will be a default value,If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.-----Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]#State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]#Locality Name (eg, city) []#Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]#Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []#Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []#darcy.cisco.exampleEmail Address []#Please enter the following 'extra' attributesto be sent with your certificate requestA challenge password []#An optional company name []#scadora@darcy#/etc/ssl/certs$Finally, use your rootCA certificate to sign the CSR (“darcy.csr”) you just generated and create a certificate for Pipeline (“darcy.pem”)#scadora@darcy#/etc/ssl/certs$ openssl x509 -req -in darcy.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out darcy.pem -days 500 -sha256Signature oksubject=/C=AU/ST=Some-State/O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd/CN=darcy.cisco.exampleGetting CA Private Keyscadora@darcy#/etc/ssl/certs$Note# Some people issue certificates with a Common Name set to the IP address of the server instead of a FQDN.  Should you do this for the Pipeline certificate, bear in mind that the certificate will also need to have a Subject Alternative Name section that explicitly lists all valid IP addresses.  If you see the following message in your grpc trace, this could be your problem.RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#show grpc trace emsTue May 16 19#35#44.792 UTC3 wrapping entries (141632 possible, 320 allocated, 0 filtered, 3 total)May 16 19#35#40.240 ems/grpc 0/RP0/CPU0 t26842 EMS-GRPC# grpc# Conn.resetTransport failed to create client transport# connection error# desc = ~transport# x509# cannot validate certificate for 172.30.8.4 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs~For more info on certificates with IP Addresses, take a look at this discussion.3. Copy rootCA Certificate to the routerFor the router to validate Pipeline’s certificate, it needs to have a copy of the rootCA certificate in /misc/config/grpc/dialout/dialout.pem (the filename is important!).

TLS is the default for MDT for gRPC, so the destination-group config just looks like this#telemetry model-driven destination-group DGroup2  address family ipv4 172.30.8.4 port 57500   encoding self-describing-gpb   protocol grpc tls-hostname darcy.cisco.exampleIn that last line, the tls-hostname (darcy.cisco.example) must match the Common Name (CN) in Pipeline’s certificate.Configuring Pipeline for tls=trueWe can use the [gRPCDIalout] input stage in the default pipeline.conf.  The only change is the last 4 lines where we enable tls and set the pem, key and servername to the values corresponding to the Pipeline certificate we generated earlier.scadora@darcy#~/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline$ grep -A30 ~gRPCDialout~ pipeline.conf | grep -v -e '^#' -e '^$'[gRPCDialout] stage = xport_input type = grpc encap = gpb listen = #57500 tls = true tls_pem = /etc/ssl/certs/darcy.pem tls_key = /etc/ssl/certs/darcy.key tls_servername = darcy.cisco.exampleAnd that’s it.

You’re done with gRPC Dialout with TLS.  No need to read further.gRPC DialinIn a dialin scenario, Pipeline sends the TCP SYN packet and acts as the “client” in the gRPC session and TLS handshake (if you’re configuring TLS).Common Router Config for gRPC DialInFor this part of the tutorial, I’ll re-use the MDT router config from the gRPC dialin example  It should look like this#grpc port 57500!telemetry model-driven sensor-group SGroup3  sensor-path openconfig-interfaces#interfaces/interface ! subscription Sub3  sensor-group-id SGroup3 sample-interval 30000Note that there is no destination-group for dialin.Common Dialin CredentialsRegardless of whether you use TLS or not, Pipeline will have to provide a username and password when it first connects to the router.On the router side, you need to configure a username and password that Pipeline can use when it dials in.  If you’re just doing a quick test in the lab, assign the user to one of these default usergroups# sysadmin, netadmin, or root-lr.  For example#username mdt group sysadmin secret 5 $1$kAbv$xNk9KA.mIC7K2wfdpGjzk1If you want to be more restrictive, here is the minimal taskgroup that you will need to support telemetry for gRPC dialin#taskgroup mdt-grpc task read li task read acl task read cdp task read eem task read boot task read diag task read ipv4 task read ipv6 task read snmp task read vpdn task read crypto task read system task read logging task read fault-mgr task read interface task read ext-access task read filesystem task read tty-access task read config-mgmt task read ip-services task read host-services task read basic-services task read config-services!usergroup mdt-grpc taskgroup mdt-grpc!username mdt group mdt-grpc secret 5 $1$kAbv$xNk9KA.mIC7K2wfdpGjzk1Next, you get to decide if you want to use TLS or not.gRPC Dialin Without TLSIf you don’t use TLS, your MDT data won’t be encrypted.  On the other hand, there’s less fiddling with certificates. So if you’re trying to get gRPC dialin to work for the first time, this might be a good starting place. There’s nothing you need to add to the router config for this beyond the common router config and credentials we did above. You just need to configure and run Pipeline as shown below.You can use the [mymdtrouter] input stage in the default pipeline.conf.  Just uncomment the 8 lines shown below, changing the server line to match your router’s IP address and configured gRPC port#$ grep -A48 ~mymdtrouter~ pipeline.conf | grep -v -e '^#' -e '^$' [mymdtrouter] stage = xport_input type = grpc encoding = gpbkv encap = gpb server = 172.30.8.53#57500 subscriptions = Sub3 tls = falseNote that the subscription is “Sub3”, which matches the subscription in the router configuration above.  Pipeline will request the pre-configured subscription from the router when it connects.When you run pipeline, you will be prompted for a username and password.  This is the username and password that you configured on the router above.$ bin/pipeline -config pipeline.confStartup pipelineLoad config from [pipeline.conf], logging in [pipeline.log]CRYPT Client [mymdtrouter],[172.30.8.53#57500] Enter username# mdt Enter password#Wait for ^C to shutdownIf you don’t want to have to manually enter the username and password each time you run Pipeline, check out the section below on secure password storage in pipeline.To verify that the connection is established, check that the subscription Destination Group State is Active. Also note that the Destination Group Id has been dynamically created (since we don’t configure a destination-group on the router for dialin) and begins with “DialIn_.”RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#show telemetry model sub Sub3Thu May 18 20#46#38.658 UTCSubscription#  Sub3-------------  State#       ACTIVE  Sensor groups#  Id# SGroup3    Sample Interval#      30000 ms    Sensor Path#          openconfig-interfaces#interfaces/interface    Sensor Path State#    Resolved  Destination Groups#  Group Id# DialIn_1019    Destination IP#       172.30.8.4    Destination Port#     48667    Encoding#             self-describing-gpb    Transport#            dialin    State#                Active    No TLS    Total bytes sent#     5723    Total packets sent#   4    Last Sent time#       2017-05-18 20#46#28.2143492698 +0000That’s it, you’re done.  No need to read the next section unless you want to do TLS.gRPC Dialin With TLSIn a dialin scenario, Pipeline acts as the “client” in the TLS handshake.  Therefore, the router will need to send a certificate to authenticate itself to Pipeline.There are a couple ways to go about creating the router certificate. If you already have a root CA, you can issue a certificate for the router.  However, because this tutorial is far too long already, I’m going to take the easy way out and use a self-signed certificate.Router Certificate and Config for gRPC TLS DialInThe first thing we have to do is enable the gRPC service on the router for TLS by adding “tls” to the grpc config on the router#grpc port 57500 tlsOnce you do this, the router automatically generates a self-signed cert called “ems.pem”#RP/0/RP0/CPU0#SunC#bashThu May 18 23#05#51.266 UTC[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#~]$cd /misc/config/grpc[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#/misc/config/grpc]$lsdialout  ems.key  ems.pem[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#/misc/config/grpc]$You can use standard openssl commands to view the cert#[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#/misc/config/grpc]$openssl x509 -noout -text -in ems.pemCertificate#    Data#        Version# 3 (0x2)        Serial Number# 1789 (0x6fd)    Signature Algorithm# sha512WithRSAEncryption        Issuer# C=US, ST=CA, L=San Jose/street=3700 Cisco Way/postalCode=95134, O=Cisco Systems, Inc., OU=CSG, CN=ems.cisco.com/serialNumber=949DF85F746        Validity            Not Before# May 18 22#49#51 2017 GMT            Not After # May 18 22#49#51 2037 GMT        Subject# C=US, ST=CA, L=San Jose/street=3700 Cisco Way/postalCode=95134, O=Cisco Systems, Inc., OU=CSG, CN=ems.cisco.com/serialNumber=949DF85F746        Subject Public Key Info#            Public Key Algorithm# rsaEncryption                Public-Key# (2048 bit)                Modulus#                    00#cf#89#9e#7a#14#5f#6a#f4#8a#75#ce#69#07#00#                    38#2d#5d#1f#71#f5#cb#69#37#3b#6d#9b#20#ab#47#                    9e#2b#b6#4b#be#30#1e#54#81#76#4f#61#91#de#4e#                    47#80#b2#6d#0c#f3#2a#69#be#85#67#ca#a3#80#7f#                    bc#40#2e#63#5d#c9#ec#a4#fc#60#ae#b2#10#2a#f9#                    de#02#11#50#5a#1e#43#c9#3a#95#6b#9f#fa#3d#f4#                    db#1f#a9#6d#bd#7b#0b#d8#87#64#08#26#2b#54#82#                    42#2f#a2#7e#36#64#9b#42#9a#ff#bf#19#25#2f#42#                    3e#9d#94#af#fc#ea#62#ef#ec#57#20#57#d9#39#c5#                    bd#77#5c#a9#01#76#e1#2c#69#67#6f#b7#30#f8#f8#                    2c#d1#2c#25#de#66#46#fb#49#30#a7#c9#9c#14#b0#                    70#f4#3f#b2#62#8c#5c#c6#8f#a2#e3#de#75#c3#c3#                    e5#72#1f#4e#40#d4#bd#1b#2a#27#19#e7#80#b3#c9#                    cb#56#4e#5c#99#42#d6#97#23#04#6d#9c#9e#f0#d2#                    0e#8b#5c#02#09#d1#c8#31#04#23#b4#f1#b4#41#a2#                    44#b5#16#fd#c3#80#a5#3d#39#26#de#94#2b#db#22#                    d0#0b#07#92#2d#6a#24#37#d4#db#b2#29#23#f3#00#                    88#13                Exponent# 65537 (0x10001)        X509v3 extensions#            X509v3 Basic Constraints# critical            CA#TRUE            X509v3 Subject Key Identifier#                1C#B6#98#EF#7F#A4#1D#07#0B#6F#73#01#08#E6#0C#8C#97#AC#E0#A2            X509v3 Authority Key Identifier#                keyid#1C#B6#98#EF#7F#A4#1D#07#0B#6F#73#01#08#E6#0C#8C#97#AC#E0#A2    Signature Algorithm# sha512WithRSAEncryption         60#97#b9#e2#cb#d5#1d#b0#48#d5#68#fa#aa#a6#36#de#e3#64#         1f#6a#7f#4b#3e#9c#42#e8#59#23#26#14#c1#b1#0e#f3#17#d5#         34#71#4c#79#6f#f7#62#94#21#a2#d7#d4#99#cc#9c#f2#29#2a#         38#79#19#83#fd#a9#16#df#0e#35#55#5e#11#b5#b7#3f#e6#10#         0d#71#c7#3d#2d#9b#41#44#09#9b#b3#98#64#ab#9e#33#f3#08#         a9#f0#6b#62#93#18#7e#ff#14#a7#ea#c2#c3#3b#ed#a6#b3#69#         25#07#04#41#23#82#c6#12#23#6d#e0#14#80#7c#10#dd#ea#06#         8e#e6#78#f5#42#a0#3e#21#81#7d#48#29#18#29#0a#ef#ce#a1#         7c#38#7b#e8#17#44#db#24#37#ba#1c#53#6d#9d#6f#d2#5c#2a#         69#b5#11#13#4d#7c#cc#3d#44#d2#96#fa#71#41#3a#b6#ab#6e#         e7#b1#ff#53#db#e8#95#5c#67#68#51#80#ab#24#e0#7e#8e#fe#         e1#af#36#8c#bc#b2#3a#69#3f#33#bc#b6#36#25#ad#78#49#d1#         2e#43#6f#f8#80#c3#1c#21#89#cd#da#9f#3d#62#ec#79#1b#b0#         77#0d#96#c8#c8#26#25#0b#94#ae#21#14#d1#1b#e0#f7#11#af#         61#ce#13#74[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#/misc/config/grpc]$As you can see, this certificate has been issued for a CN=ems.cisco.com and is a CA certificate.Since this is also the CA cert (it’s self-signed), we’ll transfer it to the server running Pipeline.[xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#/misc/config/grpc]$ scp ems.pem scadora@172.30.8.4#scadora@172.30.8.4's password#ems.pem                                       100% 1513     1.5KB/s   00#00    [xr-vm_node0_RP0_CPU0#/misc/config/grpc]$Pipeline for gRPC Dialin with TLSAll that’s left is to configure pipeline.conf for TLS.You can use the [mymdtrouter] input stage in the default pipeline.conf.

The purpose of this document is to give you a lot of details about Telemetry on NCS1002 (terminal device). The goal is not only to give you some information about valuable sensor paths for NCS1002, but also to provide all the pieces for you to start exploring Telemetry on NCS1002 right away.Model-driven Telemetry (MDT) provides a mechanism to stream data from an MDT-capable device to a destination(s). There are several core components of Streaming Telemetry you should know and understand#  “Sensor path”. Describes the data you want your NCS1002 to stream to a collector (for example, OSNR values from your line ports)  “Transport protocol”. Describes the protocol you want to use to deliver to your collector/controller the information you selected with sensor-paths (for example, TCP)  “Encoder”. Describes the format of the data on the wire (for example, GPB)  “Initialization of streaming session”. Describes who initiates the streaming of data from the router towards the collector. Two possible options are# dial-in mode (the collector initiates a session to the router and subscribes to data to be streamed out) or dial-out mode (the router initiates a session to the destinations based on the subscription.)  “Subscription”. Binds everything together for the router to start streaming data on the configured intervals.There is no need to go in details about telemetry, as there are many different technical documents available in xrdocs-telemetry, and you can also find configuration information on cisco.com.Sensor Paths for NCS1002With this generic understanding of telemetry, let’s now define sensor paths that could be valuable exactly for your optical deployments based on NCS1002. These paths provide valuable information about NCS1002 and that list should be pretty complete for you to start playing around and testing your optical DCI segments. Feel free to add or remove paths from the suggested list as well as optimize sample-interval timers according to your requirements.Here is a list of sensor paths for NCS1002 with some basic explanation and print screens from Grafana for better visibility#  Monitoring of CPU utilization# Cisco-IOS-XR-wdsysmon-fd-oper#system-monitoring/cpu-utilization.With this model you’re able to get information about NCS1002 CPU load for 1-, 5- and 15-min intervals.  Monitoring of memory usage# Cisco-IOS-XR-nto-misc-oper#memory-summary/nodes/node/summaryThis model helps you to have information about NCS1002 free memory availability.  Alarms# Cisco-IOS-XR-alarmgr-server-oper#alarms/brief/brief-card/brief-locations/brief-location/active.This path gives you information about currently active alarms in NCS1002.Here is an example of text-based output for active alarms on an NCS1002 under testing. You can modify your existing tools (or develop new) to collect this information either directly from a TSDB (time-series database) like InfluxDB or from Kafka platform, depending on your design.Summary# GPB(common) Message [172.16.1.1#27939(rosco_1)/Cisco-IOS-XR-alarmgr-server-oper#alarms/brief/brief-card/brief-locations/brief-location/active msg len# 3150]{    ~Source~# ~172.16.1.1#27939~,    ~Telemetry~# {        ~node_id_str~# ~rosco_1~,        ~subscription_id_str~# ~optical~,        ~encoding_path~# ~Cisco-IOS-XR-alarmgr-server-oper#alarms/brief/brief-card/brief-locations/brief-location/active~,        ~collection_id~# 24180,        ~collection_start_time~# 1508635312850,        ~msg_timestamp~# 1508635312850,        ~collection_end_time~# 1508635312858    },    ~Rows~# [        {            ~Timestamp~# 1508635312856,            ~Keys~# {                ~node-id~# ~0/RP0/CPU0~            },            ~Content~# {                ~alarm-info_PIPELINE_EDIT~# [                    {                        ~clear-time~# ~-~,                        ~clear-timestamp~# 0,                        ~description~# ~Optics0/0/0/1 - Improper Removal~,                        ~group~# ~controller~,                        ~location~# ~0/0~,                        ~set-time~# ~09/12/2017 23#30#07 PDT~,                        ~set-timestamp~# 1505284207,                        ~severity~# ~critical~                    },       {                        ~clear-time~# ~-~,                        ~clear-timestamp~# 0,                        ~description~# ~One Or More FPDs Need Upgrade Or Not In Current State~,                        ~group~# ~fpd-infra~,                        ~location~# ~0/0~,                        ~set-time~# ~09/14/2017 01#28#05 PDT~,                        ~set-timestamp~# 1505377685,                        ~severity~# ~major~                    },                    {                        ~clear-time~# ~-~,                        ~clear-timestamp~# 0,                        ~description~# ~HundredGigECtrlr0/0/0/0 - Carrier Loss On The LAN~,                        ~group~# ~ethernet~,                        ~location~# ~0/0~,                        ~set-time~# ~09/22/2017 07#46#09 PDT~,                        ~set-timestamp~# 1506091569,                        ~severity~# ~major~                    },       {                        ~clear-time~# ~-~,                        ~clear-timestamp~# 0,                        ~description~# ~Optics0/0/0/20 - Optics High Laser Bias~,                        ~group~# ~controller~,                        ~location~# ~0/0~,                        ~set-time~# ~10/19/2017 10#46#23 PDT~,                        ~set-timestamp~# 1508435183,                        ~severity~# ~minor~                    }                ]            }        }    ]}  Chassis info# Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper#platform-inventory/racks/rack/attributes/basic-info.This path is useful to get information about the serial number and software version on NCS1002.

Let’s have a look how to configure that.NCS1002 Telemetry configurationThere are many possible ways to configure a device to stream the data using telemetry. You can find a good explanation how to do it with CLI configuration [here] (https#//xrdocs.github.io/telemetry/tutorials/2016-07-21-configuring-model-driven-telemetry-mdt/) or you can configure Telemetry using YANG Development Kit (YDK), like hereLet me first show you an example configuration of models above using CLI. Telemetry configuration will be based on gRPC, Self-Describing GPB and Dial-out Mode. telemetry model-driven destination-group DGROUP1  address-family ipv4 1.1.1.1 port 5432   encoding self-describing-gpb   protocol grpc no-tls  !  address-family ipv4 10.30.110.38 port 5432   encoding self-describing-gpb   protocol grpc no-tls  ! ! sensor-group SGROUP1  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper#platform-inventory/racks/rack/attributes/basic-info  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-plat-chas-invmgr-oper#platform-inventory/racks/rack/slots/slot/cards/card/port-   slots/port-slot/portses/ports/hw-components/hw-component/attributes/basic-info ! sensor-group SGROUP2  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-wdsysmon-fd-oper#system-monitoring/cpu-utilization  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-nto-misc-oper#memory-summary/nodes/node/summary  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-alarmgr-server-oper#alarms/brief/brief-card/brief-locations/brief-location/active ! sensor-group SGROUP3  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-controller-optics-oper-sub1#optics-oper/optics-ports/optics-port/optics-info  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-pmengine-oper#performance-management/otu/otu-ports/otu-port/otu-current/otu-second30/otu-second30fecs/otu-second30fec  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-pmengine-oper#performance-management/otu/otu-ports/otu-port/otu-current/otu-second30/otu-second30otns/otu-second30otn  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-pmengine-oper#performance-management/ethernet/ethernet-ports/ethernet-port/ethernet-current/ethernet-second30/second30-ethers/second30-ether  sensor-path Cisco-IOS-XR-pmengine-oper#performance-management/optics/optics-ports/optics-port/optics-current/optics-second30/optics-second30-optics/optics-second30-optic ! subscription Sub1  sensor-group-id SGROUP1 sample-interval 1800000  destination-id DGROUP1 ! subscription Sub2  sensor-group-id SGROUP2 sample-interval 20000  destination-id DGROUP1 ! subscription Sub3  sensor-group-id SGROUP3 sample-interval 10000  destination-id DGROUP1 !MDT configuration using CLI is very straightforward and simple.More interesting and powerful way to configure telemetry on NCS1002 is through YDK. If you want to read more about YDK, a lot of details and information can be found here with hundreds of examples here. Let’s briefly cover major parts of YDK for NCS1002 telemetry configuration for your convenience. For this example I will use native IOS-XR telemetry YANG model. Configuration is based on gRPC Dial-out with self-describing GPB model (the same as it was with CLI).Let’s start with configuring destination address/port, encoding and transport protocol# destination_group = telemetry_model_driven.destination_groups.DestinationGroup()## the name of this destination groupdestination_group.destination_id = 'DGROUP'ipv4_destination = destination_group.ipv4_destinations.Ipv4Destination()## address and port of the server configurationipv4_destination.destination_port = 57500ipv4_destination.ipv4_address = 10.30.110.38## define encodingipv4_destination.encoding = xr_telemetry_model_driven_cfg.EncodeTypeEnum.self_describing_gpbprotocol = ipv4_destination.Protocol()## define the transport protocolprotocol.protocol = xr_telemetry_model_driven_cfg.ProtoTypeEnum.grpcprotocol.no_tls = 1ipv4_destination.protocol = protocoldestination_group.ipv4_destinations.ipv4_destination.append(ipv4_destination)telemetry_model_driven.destination_groups.destination_group.append(destination_group)After destination, encoding and transport configuration, let’s configure a sensor-group with one sensor path# sensor_group = telemetry_model_driven.sensor_groups.SensorGroup()## the name of this sensor-groupsensor_group.sensor_group_identifier = 'SGROUP'sensor_group.enable = Empty()        ## define the path you want to be collectedsensor_path = sensor_group.sensor_paths.SensorPath()sensor_path.telemetry_sensor_path = 'Cisco-IOS-XR-nto-misc-oper#memory-summary/nodes/node/summary'sensor_group.sensor_paths.sensor_path.append(sensor_path)   telemetry_model_driven.sensor_groups.sensor_group.append(sensor_group)The final step is to define subscription and configure all together# subscription = telemetry_model_driven.subscriptions.Subscription()## name of the subscription groupsubscription.subscription_identifier = ~Sub1~sensor_profile = subscription.sensor_profiles.SensorProfile()## attach the sensor-groupsensor_profile.sensorgroupid = 'SGROUP1'## define the intervalsensor_profile.sample_interval = 20000subscription.sensor_profiles.sensor_profile.append(sensor_profile) sensor_profile = subscription.sensor_profiles.SensorProfile()## define destination group to be useddestination_profile = subscription.destination_profiles.DestinationProfile()destination_profile.destination_id = 'DGROUP1'destination_profile.enable = Empty()subscription.destination_profiles.destination_profile.append(destination_profile) telemetry_model_driven.subscriptions.subscription.append(subscription)That’s it! The full version with all sensor paths and two destinations can be found here. You can also find there YDK configurations for few other modes, including configurations using OpenConfig models (feel free to modify them and use as you need!)NCS1002 telemetry data consumptionAt this step we defined the data we want to stream out of an NCS1002. We configured Model-Driven Telemetry with destination, encoding, transport and sampling details. The final step for our task will be to collect and process this data.There are several ways to achieve this and you’re free to use any one that you like. For those of you who have just started looking into telemetry, there are several files at the end to help with faster adoption and testing of things described above.Steps you need to do have your collector up and running#      Clone/download “pipeline” on your server. Pipeline can be found here and the basic overview of pipeline is here        Download and install “InfluxDB” on your server. The link for download is here        Make sure “pipeline” streams data to “InfluxDB”. How to do this is here. And make sure you don’t forget to create a database!        Install Grafana and add “InfluxDB” database. The link to Grafana is here or go to their github link  After these steps are done, you will need to install correct “metrics.json” file that will contain descriptions of models described in this tutorial. For Grafana you will need to have a dashboard configured. As i mentioned above, these files are already prepared for you! You can get “metrics.json” here and the dashboard for NCS1002 for Grafana can be found here.NCS1002 with IOS XR 6.2.2, YDK version 0.5.4, Grafana 4.2.0, InfluxDB v1.0.0 and Python 2.7 were used.ConclusionTelemetry is the modern way to get almost real-time information from your NCS1002 devices. In this tutorial, we covered valuable sensor paths for NCS1002, how to configure them with CLI and YDK and how to process. Try telemetry on NCS1002 today and stay tuned for our next updates.
